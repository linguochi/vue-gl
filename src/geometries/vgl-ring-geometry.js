/**
 * This is a simple shape component of Euclidean geometry,
 * corresponding [THREE.RingGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/geometries/RingGeometry).
 * It is contructed from a number of triangular segments that are oriented around a central point
 * and extend as far out as a given radius.
 * It is built counter-clockwise from a start angle and a given central angle.
 * It can also be used to create regular polygons,
 * where the number of segments determines the number of sides.
 *
 * Properties of [VglGeometry](../core/vgl-geometry) are also available as mixin.
